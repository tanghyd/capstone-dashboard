Sofoulis (Sofoulis, 1960). Sofoulis recorded the presence of iron at Iron Knob (Mt Finnerty) although noting the low grades shown by the jaspilites. Prospective BIF units and several areas of surficial Fe enrichments within the project area have been identified by a combination of detailed aeromagnetics, semi-regional geological mapping by Reed Resource Ltd and the collection of a number of potentially ore grade samples. This led to Cliffs interest in the project and ultimately to the current Mt Finnerty JV Subsequent to the establishment of the Mt Finnerty JV, Cliffs have carried out reconnaissance mapping and sampling in a number of phases over surface iron enrichment first noted by Reed Resources, resulting in the delineation of 10 primary targets (FIN1 to FIN9 and FIN8_9).","1957, 1960","Cliffs, Cliffs","iron, Iron, iron",,"jaspilites, BIF",,,"presence of, low grades, Prospective, potentially"
