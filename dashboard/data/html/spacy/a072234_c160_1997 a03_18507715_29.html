<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">If a large data set that covers a variety of rock types (and may include variations in sampling techniques) is not split in some manner, then very high value (or values) will obscure any more subtle responses from other areas - say a very poorly exposed system with weak leakage compared to something that is readily seen and sampled.

 groups show then application of field data (or need to collect more field data) becomes more critical. This has the ability to make more subtle targets visible/discreet and therefore they can then be more effectively explored. There are some cautions with some of the smaller or apparently &quot;unusual&quot; groups that can appear in any set (sometimes a function of too few samples etc) and also with elements that tend to only occur at around detection levels.</div>
